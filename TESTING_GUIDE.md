## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Registration fields don't change when selecting role
**Solution:** The JavaScript now explicitly sets `display: block/none` on role change. Refresh the page and try again.

### Issue: Can't scroll on registration page
**Solution:** The auth page now uses `min-height: 100vh` instead of fixed height. The form panel scrolls naturally.

### Issue: Admin dashboard doesn't load
**Solution:** Make sure you're logged in as admin (admin@campus.edu / Admin@123). Check browser console for errors.

### Issue: Chatbot doesn't appear
**Solution:** Ensure `js/chatbot.js` is loaded. Check browser console for JavaScript errors.
