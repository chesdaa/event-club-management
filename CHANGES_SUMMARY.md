# 🎉 All Changes Completed!

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. Registration Conditional Fields - FIXED ✅

- Enhanced JavaScript to explicitly toggle display property
- Student fields now hide when Organizer is selected
- Organizer field shows when Organizer is selected

### 2. Terms of Service Page - REDESIGNED ✅

**Solution:**

- Smaller cards and spacing

### 4. Featured Events & Popular Clubs - 4 PER ROW ✅
