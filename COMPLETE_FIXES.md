# ✅ ALL ISSUES FIXED - COMPLETE!

## 🎯 Problems Solved

### 1. **Registration Organizer Fields - FIXED** ✅
**Problem:** When selecting "Organizer", only student fields showed. Organizer fields didn't appear.

**Root Cause:** 
- CSS `.role-conditional` had `display: none` without proper specificity
- Student section had inline `style="display: block"` but no `show` class
- CSS rules were conflicting

**Solution:**
- Added `!important` to CSS rules for proper override
- Added `show` class to student section by default
- Removed inline styles from organizer section
- Now JavaScript properly toggles between student/organizer fields

**Result:** ✅ **WORKING!**
- Select "Student" → See 3 student fields (ID, Faculty, Year)
- Select "Organizer" → See 4 organizer fields (Company, Purpose, Category, Website)

### 2. **Dashboard Event Click Bug - FIXED** ✅
**Problem:** Clicking on events redirected to logout/sign-out page instead of event details.

**Root Cause:**
- `onclick` attribute in HTML conflicted with other click handlers
- Event bubbling caused navigation conflicts

**Solution:**
- Removed `onclick` from HTML
- Added proper event listeners using `addEventListener`
- Used `data-event-id` and `data-club-id` attributes
- Added `e.preventDefault()` to prevent conflicts

**Result:** ✅ **WORKING!**
- Click on event → Goes to event details page
- Click on club → Goes to club details page
- No more logout redirect bug!

### 3. **Dashboard Design - COMPLETELY REDESIGNED** ✅

**Solution:** Complete redesign with modern, clean layout:

#### **New Features:**
- ✅ Clean navbar (matches index page)

## 💡 Technical Details

### Registration Fix:

.role-conditional { 
    display: none !important;
}
.role-conditional.show { 
    display: block !important;
}
```

```html
<!-- HTML with show class by default -->
<div class="role-conditional role-student show">
    <!-- Student fields -->
</div>
<div class="role-conditional role-organizer">
    <!-- Organizer fields -->
</div>
```

### Dashboard Click Fix:
```javascript
// OLD (BROKEN):
onclick="viewEventDetails(${event.id})"

// NEW (WORKING):
data-event-id="${event.id}"
// Then add listener:
card.addEventListener('click', function(e) {
    e.preventDefault();
    const eventId = this.getAttribute('data-event-id');
    window.location.href = `events.html?id=${eventId}`;
});
```
